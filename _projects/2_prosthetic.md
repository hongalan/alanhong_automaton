## Background

I started this project because my friend had lost part of his ring finger in an accident. I had been following the work of the e-NABLE community for a few months and decided that I could use my engineering background to help. After sharing it with my friend, I decided to share it with the e-NABLE community. During this time, I attended R&D sessions and volunteered to contribute designs.

### Process

The model was made in SolidWorks and was directly based on my ring finger. This was done by importing images of the finger from several perspecties and generating the lofted body from cross-sectional profiles. While designing the model, I prioritized an organic appearance, smooth operation, and a low profile.

### Result

The prosthetic seen in the image was printed using SLA through Shapeways to preserve fine detaill such as the holes. [It's operation can be seen here.](http://youtu.be/2M4D51JSuOw "Video")
