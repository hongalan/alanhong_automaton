## Who is this guy?

Alan is a current student at Northwestern University pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics. His goal is to combine traditional and rapidly advancing technologies to enable people achieve their full potential, and have a good time doing it. What you see in this portfolio are the steps he has taken towards achieving this.

### What has he been up to?

 Originally from New Jersey, he studied Mechanical Engineering in his undergrad at Rutgers University. During this time he was exposed to the field of robotics and developed a biomimetic vocal fold robot for his capstone project. Wanting to take this further, he directed his attention to exploring topics in robotics, automation, and human augmentation and, furthermore, the prospect of using these in everyday situations. During his post-college employment at Doosan Infracore, he worked with automated manufacturing systems and gained valuable insight on the state of robotics in the industry. Hardware and electronics have been improved over decades, but software is relatively new and under-developed. Having studied Mechanical Engineering, he decided that it was necessary to learn the software side of robotics. It was at this point that he was accepted into Northwestern University's Robotics program, where he is now working to develop a comprehensive skillset that will enable him to bring his ideas and designs to reality.

### What are his short-term goals?

 Alan is actively seeking opportunities to work in the Summer 2016 term and post-graduation December 2016. He looks forward to working among creative and ambitious individuals with whom he can share his enthusiasm for innovation as well as develop his skills in robotics.
